A Combined Model Approach for Dimension Reductiong </h2>


<br>

This study aims to provide VistaPrint, a global leader in e-commerce and mass customization, with a comprehensive ranking system for a sample of product groups based on multiple variables. The primary objective was to improve the performance of inefficient products and influence future product introductions. To achieve this, a combined approach of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) was employed, streamlining the evaluation process and reducing complexity.
The study started with a PCA application, which effectively reduced the initial set of 4 input and 3 output variables to 2 inputs and 2 outputs that explain the majority of the variance in the model. Subsequently, an input-oriented model was employed, focusing on minimizing the new input variables that were labeled Quality Control and Cost Management. Second, the basic DEA model and three other combined PCA-DEA models were tested to evaluate the efficiency of the product groups. Model 1, the basic DEA model, identified 23 efficient product groups out of the initial 34. Models 2 and 3 further refined the evaluation by reducing the dimensionality of inputs and outputs, respectively. Finally, Model 4 incorporated the joint reduction of both inputs and outputs, resulting in a more detailed efficiency evaluation and identifying 4 efficient product groups. The findings underscore the advantage of employing the PCA-DEA model when dealing with a large number of variables, as it provides a clearer distinction between efficient and ineffi- cient product groups. Additionally, specific product groups were identified that consistently demonstrated efficiency across different models, as well as those that exhibited improved efficiency after dimension reduction. Based on these findings, the fourth model was selected for further analysis with 4 benchmarks that can serve as a reference for future product introductions, contributing to the ongoing improvement of efficiency. The ranking of product groups based on efficiency scores and peersâ€™ weights offers valuable insights for decision-makers to optimize efficiency and enhance overall performance. Furthermore, the excess analysis prioritized efforts towards improving Quality Control, recognizing its significant impact on efficiency. By focusing on enhancing Quality Control measures, VistaPrint can effectively address the identified areas of improvement and further optimize their operations.
